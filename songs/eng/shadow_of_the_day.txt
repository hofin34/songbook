\beginsong{Shadow of the day}[by={Linkin Park}]

\beginverse
\[Dmi]I close both \[C]locks below the \[B]window
I close both blinds and turn away

Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes good bye's the only away
\endverse

\beginchorus
And the \[F]sun \[C]will set for \[Dmi]you \[B]
The sun will set for you

And the \[F]shadow of the \[C]day
Will \[Dmi]embrace the world in \[B]grey

And the sun will set for you
\endchorus

\beginverse
In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay

Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes good bye's the only way
\endverse
