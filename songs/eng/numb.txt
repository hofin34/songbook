\beginsong{Numb}[by={Linkin Park}]



\beginverse*
\[F#mi, D, A, E]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#mi]Im tired of being what you want \[D]me to be
\[A]Feeling so faithless lost \[E]under the surface
\[F#mi]Dont know what you're expe\[D]cting of me
Put \[A]under the pressure of \[E]walking in your shoes
(\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow)
Every \[F#mi]step that I take is a\[A]nother mistake to you
(\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow)
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F#mi]Ive become so \[D]numb I cant feel you \[A]there
Ive become so \[E]tired so much more a\[F#mi]ware
Im becoming \[D]this all I want to \[A]do
Is be more like \[E]me and be less like \[F#mi]you
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[F#mi]Cant you see that youre smo\[D]thering me
\[A]Holding too tightly a\[E]fraid to lose control
\[F#mi]Cause everything that you \[D]thought I would be
Has \[A]fallen apart \[E]right in front of you
(\[D]Caught in the undertow just \[E]caught in the undertow)
Every \[F#mi]step that I take is a\[A]nother mistake to you
(\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow)
And every \[F#mi]second I waste is more than \[A]I can take
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse
And I \[E]know I may \[F#mi]end up \[A]failing \[F#mi]too
But I \[E]know You were \[F#mi]just like me
With someone \[A]disappointed in \[E]you
\endverse
