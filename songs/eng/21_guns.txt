\beginverse
\[Am]Do you \[F]know what's \[C]worth fighting \[G]for,
\[Am]When it's \[F]not worth \[C]dying for?\[G]
\[Am]Does it \[F]take your \[C]breath a\[G]way
And you \[F]feel yourself suffo\[G]cating?
\[Am]Does the \[F]pain weigh \[C]out the \[G]pride?
\[Am]And you \[F]look for a \[C]place to \[G]hide?
\[Am]Did someone \[F]break your \[C]heart in\[G]side?
You're in \[F]ruins
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[C]One, \[G]twenty-one \[Am]guns
\[G]Lay down your \[F]arms
\[C]Give up the \[G]fight
\[C]One, \[G]twenty-one \[Am]guns
\[G]Throw up your \[F]arms \[C]into the \[G]sky,
You and \[F]I\[C]\[G]
\endchorus
\beginverse
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]Did you \[F]try to \[C]live on your own\[E]
\[Am]When you \[F]burned down the \[C]house and \[E]home?
\[Am]Did you \[F]stand too \[C]close to the \[E]fire?
Like a \[F]liar looking for for\[G]giveness from a \[C]stone

\beginverse
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins
