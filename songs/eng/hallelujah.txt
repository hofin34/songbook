\beginsong{Hallelujah}[by={Leonard Cohen}]
\beginverse
I've \[C]heard there was a \[Ami]secret chord
That \[C]David played and it \[Ami]pleased the Lord
But \[F]you don't really \[G]care for music, do \[C]you? \[G]
Well, it \[C]goes like this
The \[F]fourth, the \[G]fifth, the \[Ami]minor fall, the \[F]major lift
The \[G]baffled king com\[E7]posing Halle\[Ami]lujah
\endverse
\beginchorus
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[Ami]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]luuu\[G]uu\[C]jah
\endchorus
\beginverse
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse
Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse
Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
\endverse
