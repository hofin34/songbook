\beginsong{Boulevard Of Broken Dreams}[by={Green Day}]
\beginverse
\[Emi]I walk a \[G]lonely road
The \[D]only one that \[A]I have ever \[Emi]known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
\endverse
\beginverse
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
\endverse
\beginverse*
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk a
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[C]My sha\[G]dow's the \[D]only one that \[Emi]walks beside me
\[C]My shall\[G]ow \[D]heart's the only \[Emi]thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I \[H7]walk alone
\endchorus
\beginverse*
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
\endverse
\beginverse
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone
\endverse
\beginverse
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and every thing's all right
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone
\endverse
\beginverse*
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk a
\endverse
