\beginsong{I'm a Believer}[by={The Monkees}]
\beginverse
\[G]I thought love was \[D]only true in \[G]fairy tales
\[G]Meant for someone \[D]else but not for \[G]me
Ah, \[C]love was out to \[G]get to me
\[C]That's the way it \[G]seemed
\[C]Disappointment \[G]haunted all my \[D]dreams
\endverse
\beginchorus
Then I saw her \[G]fac\[C, G]e
Now I'm a be\[G]liever\[C, G]
Not a tr\[G]ace\[C, G]
Of doubt in my \[G]mind\[C G]
I'm in l\[G]ove \[C]ooh
I'm a be\[G]liever I couldn't \[F]leave her if I \[D]tried
\endchorus
\beginverse
I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seemed the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
