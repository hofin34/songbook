\beginverse
\[D]I thought love was \[A]only true in \[D]fairy tales
\[D]Meant for someone \[A]else but not for \[D]me
Ah, \[C]love was out to \[D]get to me
\[C]That's the way it \[D]seemed
\[C]Disappointment \[D]haunted all my \[A]dreams
\endverse
\beginchorus
Then I saw her \[D]fac\[G, D]e
Now I'm a be\[D]liever\[G, D]
Not a tr\[D]ace\[G, D]
Of doubt in my \[D]mind\[G D]
I'm in l\[D]ove \[G]ooh
I'm a be\[D]liever I couldn't \[C]leave her if I \[A]tried
\endchorus
\beginverse
I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seemed the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
