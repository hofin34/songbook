\beginsong{Hero Of War}[by={Rise Against}]
\beginverse
He said, \[G]“Son,
Have you see the \[Hmi]world?
Well, what would you\[C]say
If I said that you\[G] could?
Just carry this \[C]gun and you’ll even get\[G]paid.”
I said, “That sounds pretty \[D]good.”
\endverse
\beginverse
Black leather \[G]boots
Spit-shined so \[Hmi]bright
They cut off my \[C]hair but it looked \[G]alright
We marched and we \[C]sang
We all became \[G]friends
As we learned \[D]how to fight
\endverse
\beginchorus

A hero of \[Em]war

Yeah that’s what I’ll \[C]be

And when I come \[G]home

They’ll be damn proud of \[D]me

I’ll carry this \[Em]flag

To the grave if I \[C]must

Because it’s flag that I \[G]love

And a flag that I \[D]trust
\endchorus
\beginverse

I kicked in the \[G]door

I yelled my \[Hmi]commands

The children, they \[C]cried

But I got my \[G]man

We took him \[C]away

A bag over his \[G]face

From his family and his \[D]friends
\endverse
\beginverse
They took off his \[G]clothes

They pissed in his \[Hmi]hands

I told them to \[C]stop

But then I joi\[G]ned in

We beat him with g\[C]uns

And batons not just on\[G]ce

But again and ag\[D]ain
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse

She wal\[G]ked through bullets and h\[Hmi]aze

I asked her to s\[C]top

I begged her to s\[G]tay

But she pressed \[C] on

So I lifted my \[G]gun

And I fired a\[D]way
\endverse
\beginverse
And the sh\[G]ells jumped through the\[Hmi] smoke

And into the sa\[C]nd

That the blood now had s\[G]oaked
A
She collapsed with a flag in her \[G]hand

A flag white as\[D] snow
\endverse
\beginchorus
A hero of w\[Em]ar

Is that what they \[C]see

Just medals and sca\[G]rs

So damn proud of\[D] me

And I brought home that flag

Now it gathers du\[C]st

But it’s a flag that I \[G]love

It’s the only flag I t\[D]rust
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[G]He said, Son, have you seen the \[Hmi]world?

Well what would you \[C]say, if I said that you \[G]could?
