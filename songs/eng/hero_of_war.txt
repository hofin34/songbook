\beginsong{Hero Of War}[by={Rise Against}]
\beginverse
He said, \[E]“Son,
Have you see the \[G#mi]world?
Well, what would you\[A]say
If I said that you\[E] could?
Just carry this \[A]gun and you’ll even get\[E]paid.”
I said, “That sounds pretty \[H]good.”
\endverse
\beginverse
Black leather \[E]boots
Spit-shined so \[G#mi]bright
They cut off my \[A]hair but it looked \[E]alright
We marched and we \[A]sang
We all became \[E]friends
As we learned \[H]how to fight
\endverse
\beginchorus

A hero of \[C#mi]war

Yeah that’s what I’ll \[A]be

And when I come \[E]home

They’ll be damn proud of \[H]me

I’ll carry this \[C#mi]flag

To the grave if I \[A]must

Because it’s flag that I \[E]love

And a flag that I \[H]trust
\endchorus
\beginverse

I kicked in the door

I yelled my commands

The children, they cried

But I got my man

We took him away

A bag over his face

From his family and his friends
\endverse
\beginverse
They took off his clothes

They pissed in his hands

I told them to stop

But then I joined in

We beat him with guns

And batons not just once

But again and again
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse

She walked through bullets and haze

I asked her to stop

I begged her to stay

But she pressed  on

So I lifted my gun

And I fired away
\endverse
\beginverse
And the shells jumped through the smoke

And into the sand

That the blood now had soaked

She collapsed with a flag in her hand

A flag white as snow
\endverse
\beginchorus
A hero of w\[C#mi]ar

Is that what they \[A]see

Just medals and sca\[E]rs

So damn proud of\[H] me

And I brought home that flag

Now it gathers du\[A]st

But it’s a flag that I \[E]love

It’s the only flag I t\[H]rust
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[E]He said, Son, have you seen the \[G#mi]world?

Well what would you \[A]say, if I said that you \[E]could?
