\beginsong{Hero Of War}[by={Rise Against}]
\beginverse
He said, \[E]“Son,
Have you see the \[G#mi]world?
Well, what would you\[A]say
If I said that you\[E] could?
Just carry this \[A]gun and you’ll even get\[E]paid.”
I said, “That sounds pretty \[H]good.”
\endverse
\beginverse
Black leather \[E]boots
Spit-shined so \[G#mi]bright
They cut off my \[A]hair but it looked \[E]alright
We marched and we \[A]sang
We all became \[E]friends
As we learned \[H]how to fight
\endverse
\beginchorus

A hero of \[C#mi]war

Yeah that’s what I’ll \[A]be

And when I come \[E]home

They’ll be damn proud of \[H]me

I’ll carry this \[C#mi]flag

To the grave if I \[A]must

Because it’s flag that I \[E]love

And a flag that I \[H]trust
\endchorus
\beginverse

I kicked in the \[E]door

I yelled my \[G#mi]commands

The children, they \[A]cried

But I got my \[E]man

We took him \[A]away

A bag over his \[E]face

From his family and his \[H]friends
\endverse
\beginverse
They took off his \[E]clothes

They pissed in his \[G#mi]hands

I told them to \[A]stop

But then I joi\[E]ned in

We beat him with g\[A]uns

And batons not just on\[E]ce

But again and ag\[H]ain
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse

She wal\[E]ked through bullets and h\[G#mi]aze

I asked her to s\[A]top

I begged her to s\[E]tay

But she pressed \[A] on

So I lifted my \[E]gun

And I fired a\[H]way
\endverse
\beginverse
And the sh\[E]ells jumped through the\[G#mi] smoke

And into the sa\[A]nd

That the blood now had s\[E]oaked
A
She collapsed with a flag in her \[E]hand

A flag white as\[H] snow
\endverse
\beginchorus
A hero of w\[C#mi]ar

Is that what they \[A]see

Just medals and sca\[E]rs

So damn proud of\[H] me

And I brought home that flag

Now it gathers du\[A]st

But it’s a flag that I \[E]love

It’s the only flag I t\[H]rust
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[E]He said, Son, have you seen the \[G#mi]world?

Well what would you \[A]say, if I said that you \[E]could?
