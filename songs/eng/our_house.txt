\beginverse
I remember way back then when everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time such a fine time
Such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us two dreamers
\endverse
\beginchorus
Our house, was our castle and our keep - Our house, in the middle of our
street
Our house, that was where we used to sleep - Our house, in the middle of our
street
Our house, in the middle of our street
\endchorus
