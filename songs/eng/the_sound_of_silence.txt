\beginsong{The Sound of Silence}[by={Simon and Garfunkel}]
\beginverse
H\[Ami]ello darkness my old fri\[G]end, I've come to talk with you ag\[Ami]ain.
Because a \[C]vision softly \[F]creep\[C]ing left it's seed while I w\[F]as
sleep\[C]ing,
And the \[F]vision that was planted in my br\[C]ain still rem\[Ami]ains
\[C]Within the s\[G]ounds of si\[Ami]lence.
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]In restless dreams I walked al\[G]one, narrow streets of cobble st\[Ami]one.
'Neath the h\[C]alo of \[F]a street l\[C]amp, I turned my collar to the c\[F]old
and d\[C]amp,
When my \[F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon l\[C]ight that split the
n\[Ami]ight
And t\[C]ouched the \[G]sounds of si\[Ami]lence.
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]And in the naked light I \[G]saw ten thousand people, maybe m\[Ami]ore.
People talking \[C]witho\[F]ut speak\[C]ing, People hearing with\[F]out
listen\[C]ing,
People \[F]writing songs that voices never sh\[C]ared, and no one d\[Ami]ared
Dist\[C]urb the \[G]sounds of si\[Ami]lence.
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]Fools! said I, you do not \[G]know, Silence like a cancer gr\[Ami]ows.
Hear my words that \[C]I m\[F]ight teach \[C]you, take my arms that I m\[F]ight
reach \[C]you.
But my w\[F]ords like silent raindrops \[C]fell...
And ech\[Ami]oed \[C]in the \[G]wells of si\[Ami]lence.
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]And the people bowed and pr\[G]ayed to the neon gods they m\[Ami]ade.
And the sign flashed \[C]out \[F]its warn\[C]ing, In the words that it \[F]was
form\[C]ing,
And the sign said, The w\[F]ords of the prophets are written on the subway
\[C]walls and tenement h\[Ami]alls.
And wh\[C]ispered in the \[G]sounds of si\[Ami]lence.
\endverse
