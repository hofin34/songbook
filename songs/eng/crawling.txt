\beginsong{Crawling}[by={Linkin Park}]


\beginchorus 
\[Am]Crawling in my \[F]skin
These \[C]wounds, they will not \[G]heal
\[Am]Fear is how I \[F]fall
Con\[C]fusing what is \[G]real
\endchorus

\beginverse 
\[Am]There's something inside me that \[F]pulls beneath the surface
\[C]Consuming, \[G]confusing
\[Am]This lack of self control I \[F]fear is never ending

\[C]Controlling

\[G]I can't seem
\endverse
 

 


\beginverse* 
To \[F]find myself a\[G]gain
My walls are closing \[Am]in

\textit{(without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)}
\[F]I've felt this way be\[G]fore
So inse\[Am]cure\[C]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]Discomfort endlessly has \[F]pulled itself upon me
\[C]Distracting, \[G]reacting
\[Am]Against my will I stand be\[F]side my own reflection
\[C]It's haunting how \[G]I can't seem...
\endverse
