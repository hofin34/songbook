\beginsong{Demons}[by={Imagine Dragons}]
\beginverse
When t\[A]he days are cold
And t\[E]he cards all fold
And t\[F#mi]he saints we see
Are a\[D]ll made of gold
When y\[A]our dreams all fail
And t\[E]he ones we hail
Are t\[F#mi]he worst of all
And t\[D]he blood’s run stale
\endverse
\beginverse
\[A]I want to hide the truth
\[E]I want to shelter you
\[F#mi]But with the beast inside
\[D]There’s nowhere we can hide

\[A]No matter what we breed
\[E]We still are made of greed
\[F#mi]This is my kingdom come
\[D]This is my kingdom come
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[A]When you feel my heat
\[E]Look into my eyes
\[F#mi]It’s where my demons hide
\[D]It’s where my demons hide
\[A]Don’t get too close
\[E]It’s dark inside
\[F#mi]It’s where my demons hide
\[D]It’s where my demons hide
\endchorus
\beginverse
Wh\[A]en the curtain’s call
Is the\[E]last of all
When \[F#mi]the lights fade out
All t\[D]he sinners crawl

So the\[A]y dug your grave
And th\[E]e masquerade
Will co\[F#mi]me calling out
At th\[D]e mess you made
\endverse
\beginverse
\[A]Don’t want to let you down
\[E]But I am hell bound
\[F#mi]Though this is all for you
\[D]Don’t want to hide the truth

\[A]No matter what we breed
\[E]We still are made of greed
\[F#mi]This is my kingdom come
\[D]This is my kingdom come
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]They say it's what you make
\[E]I say it's up to fate
\[F#mi]It's woven in my soul
\[D]I need to let you go

\[A]Your eyes, they shine so bright
\[E]I want to save their light
\[F#mi]I can't escape this now
\[D]Unless you show me how
