\beginverse
{\nolyrics INTRO: \[D] \[G] \[A] 2x}

You \[D]say that we've \[G]got no\[A]thing in \[D]common
No \[G]common \[A]ground to \[D]start from
\[G]And we're fal\[A]ling \[D]apart \[G] \[A]
\endverse
\beginverse
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
But I know you just don't care
\endverse
\beginchorus
And \[D]I said what about "\[A]Breakfast at \[G]Tiffany's?
\[D]She said, I think I re\[A]member the \[G]film,
And as \[D]I recall, I think, we \[A]both kinda \[G]liked it.
And \[D]I said, Well, that's the \[A]one thing we've \[G]got.
\endchorus
\beginverse
I see you - the only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
\endverse
\beginverse
So what now? It's plain to see we're over,
And I hate when things are over -
When so much is left undone
