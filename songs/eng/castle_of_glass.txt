\beginsong{Castle Of Glass}[by={Linkin Park}]
\beginverse
\[Hmi]Take me down to the river bend,
\[Hmi]Take me down to the fighting end,
\[A]Wash the poison from off my skin
\[Hmi]Show me how to be whole again
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Hmi]Fly me up on a silver wing
\[Hmi]Past the black where the sirens sing
\[A]Warm me up in a nova's glow
\[Hmi]\[A]nd drop me down to the dream below
\endverse
\beginchorus
Cause I'm \[G]only a \[D]crack in this \[A]castle of \[Hmi]glass
Hardly \[G]anything \[D]there for you to \[A]see.
For you to \[Hmi]see...
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Hmi]Bring me home in a blinding dream
\[Hmi]Through the secrets that I have seen
\[A]Wash the sorrow from off my skin
\[Hmi]And show me how to be whole again
\endverse
\rf
\beginchorus
Cause I'm \[G]only a \[D]crack in this \[A]castle of \[Hmi]glass
Hardly \[G]anything \[D]else I need to \[A]bee\[Hmi]eee

Cause I'm \[G]only a \[D]crack in this \[A]castle of \[Hmi]glass
Hardly \[G]anything \[D]there for you to \[A]see.
For you to \[Hmi]see...
\endchorus
