\beginsong{Castle Of Glass}[by={Linkin Park}]
\beginverse

\[C#mi]Take me down to the river bend,
\[C#mi]Take me down to the fighting end,
\[H]Wash the poison from off my skin
\[C#mi]Show me how to be whole again
\endverse
\beginverse
\[C#mi]Fly me up on a silver wing
\[C#mi]Past the black where the sirens sing
\[H]Warm me up in a nova's glow
\[C#mi]and drop me down to the dream below
\endverse
\beginchorus
Cause I'm \[A]only a \[E]crack in this \[H]castle of \[C#mi]glass
Hardly \[A]anything \[E]there for you to \[H]see.
For you to \[C#mi]see...
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[C#mi]Bring me home in a blinding dream
\[C#mi]Through the secrets that I have seen
\[H]Wash the sorrow from off my skin
\[C#mi]And show me how to be whole again
\endverse
\rf
\beginchorus
Cause I'm \[A]only a \[E]crack in this \[H]castle of \[C#mi]glass
Hardly \[A]anything \[E]else I need to \[H]bee\[C#mi]eee

Cause I'm \[A]only a \[E]crack in this \[H]castle of \[C#mi]glass
Hardly \[A]anything \[E]there for you to \[H]see.
For you to \[C#mi]see...
\endchorus
