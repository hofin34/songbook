\beginsong{Leaving On A Jet Plane}[by={Frank Sinatra}]
\beginverse
All my \[E]bags are packed, I'm \[A]ready to go
I'm \[E]standing here out\[A]side the door
I \[E]hate to wake you \[F#mi]up to say good\[B7]bye
But the \[E]dawn is breakin', it's \[A]early morn'
The \[E]taxi's waiting, and he's \[A]blowin' his horn
\[E]Already I'm so \[F#mi]lonesome, I could \[B7]cry
\endverse
\beginchorus
So \[E]kiss me and \[A]smile for me
\[E]Tell me that you'll \[A]wait for me
\[E]Hold me like you'll \[F#mi]never let me \[B7]go
'Cause \[E]I'm leavin' \[A]on a jet plane
\[E]I don't know when \[A]I'll be back again
\[E]Oh, babe, \[F#mi]I hate to \[B7]go.
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring.
\endverse
\rf
\beginverse
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say,
\endverse
